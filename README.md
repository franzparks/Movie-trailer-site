Franz Movie Trailer Website
Author: Francis Phiri

Programming Foundations with Python

Wrote server-side code in Python to store a list of my favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. This data is then served to a web page using HTML and CSS allowing visitors to review these movies and watch the trailers.

# How to Run

To run the movie trailer website, follow these steps:

Be sure that your computer supports Python 2.7.9 or higher and have a web browser installed and ready.


Afte unzipping the folder, open the movies folder and open the file entertainment_center.py and run it . A file fresh_tomatoes.html will be generated and loaded in the browser.

Click on any movie poster and a movie trailer will immediately start playing
